# Deep-Learning-Models-for-Digit-Classification-and-Super-Resolution

In this repository, LeNet5, Inception Network and SRCNN models are implementated. 
The LeNet5 is trained on MNIST dataset.
The Inception Network is has three inception layers and other convolution and maxpooling layers. It is inspired from GoogLeNet and it implements Network in Network.
The SRCNN is trained to improve resolution of image. It improves resolution from 14x14 to 28x28 on MNIST dataset.
